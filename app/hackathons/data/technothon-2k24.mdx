My very first hackathon, **Technothon 2k24**, was a thrilling 24-hour event held at Vivekanand Education 
Society's Polytechnic in Mumbai. The hackathon focused on creating innovative solutions for real-world 
problems, and I participated with a team of developers to build an **Attendance Tracking System** using 
QR codes.

And I believe this one spoiled me for all future hackathons, not just because we won, but also because
the experience was so well-organized and the atmosphere was electric. The event kicked off with a
really good breakfast, and a really well thought-out opening ceremony that set the tone for the
day. Got assigned our rooms, and then we got to work.

WiFi had no issues whatsoever, continuous supply of food and refreshments, more than we could ask for,
and a great venue with all the necessary facilities. The organizers were super supportive, and the
mentorship was also so chill. They helped us nail our brownie points without micromanaging us.

Overall, it was an unforgettable experience that not only tested our skills but also fostered a sense of
community and collaboration among participants. Winning the first place was the cherry on top, but the
experience itself was the real reward. I can't wait to participate in more hackathons like this in the future!

(also, not a lot of pics, coz I was too engulfed in the hackathon to take many)
