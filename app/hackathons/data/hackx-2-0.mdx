An actual college hackathon against college students instead of diploma students, we were so happy to get selected. Even though
it was a small hackathon, it was a great experience. We didn't really expect to win, just to get some experience and have fun.

Registration was smooth, the classrooms were great, and the food was decent. One unfortunate thing was that they
had to switch off the AC after 10 PM, which made it a bit uncomfortable for us. We also didn't get our mentorship when we were
supposed to, so we called the organizers and they arranged for it.

We got a bunch of stickers, and a bag which was pretty cool. We also networked with a few people which was nice. A very
chill hackathon, and one of the many we did in 2024. Great experience overall, and would definitely go again!
