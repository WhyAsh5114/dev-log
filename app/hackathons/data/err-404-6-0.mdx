Our first hackathon through Devfolio, with big expectations and hopes, we were excited to participate in Err_404 6.0 at M.H. 
Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai. The hackathon was a 24-hour event, and we were ready to give it our all.

It was quite far from where the team lived, travelled quite a bit to get there, excited, we reached the venue and it was chill,
but not that well developed, it was an old Mumbai college building with limited facilites,
met some friends and old acquaintances, and got to know the venue. The registration was smooth, and we were ready to start.
We had a solid idea, a well-defined tech stack, and a clear plan of action. We received our problem statements a day before, 
and we were ready to go.

Network was an issue, got an Unlimited 5G data pack from Jio, and it was a lifesaver. The hall was spacious, food was decent,
and the organizers were friendly. We had a few hiccups with the power supply, but they were resolved quickly. They gave us a
cool notebook and a bag as merch, which was a nice touch (I seem to have lost the notebook though).

We worked tirelessly, coding, testing, and debugging. The energy was high, and we were all in sync. We had a few mentors
who suggested some amazing features, and we implemented them on the fly. The other teams also thought we were doing great,
and we were feeling confident.

We presented our project, YogaSense, an AI-powered yoga app that provides real-time pose correction, personalized routines, 
and immersive AR guidance for better alignment and practice. But for some reason, the judge didn't seem to be impressed,
we were also delayed judging for quite some time, coming out of this, we felt a bit cheated and disappointed, just chalked it
up to bad luck and moved on though.
