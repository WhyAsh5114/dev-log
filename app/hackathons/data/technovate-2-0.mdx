Technovate 2.0, our first non-diploma hackathon, was a 24-hour event at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology in Mumbai. 
This hackathon focused on sustainability and environmental solutions, and we developed **EcoLyf**, a comprehensive 
carbon footprint tracking application.

Even thought the venue was hosted at SPIT, it was actually organized by the Rotary Club of Bombay, and they did a
decent job at it. The food was decent, but I was spoiled by the food at the previous hackathon, so I was a bit disappointed.
The mentorship was okay, but we didn't really need it. The stay was decent too.

Since it was just 2 members instead of 4, we mostly just goofed around and didn't really work that hard in hindsight.
The judges only appreciated the UI and the idea, we didn't add too many features, so we didn't place. It was a humbling
experience, but we learned a lot about the importance of thorough feature implementation and the value of teamwork.
