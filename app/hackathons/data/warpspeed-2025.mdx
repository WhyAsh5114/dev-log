An official Devfolio hackathon, in Bangalore! I was so excited, I had applied to the previous iterations but never got selected.
This time, I somehow got through, and I was determined to make the most of it. I unfortunately had to go alone, as my friends were
busy with other commitments. But I still had to make the most of it. I had a few ideas in mind, but I was not sure which one to pursue.

Agentic AI was a new concept for me, I only had some experience with it in my past internship, but I quit that internship quite early.
I had to learn a lot about it in a short time. I got to work with the Vercel AI SDK and LMStudio to build an AI agent that could
help users with their fitness goals. I had to learn about real-time pose detection, personalized workout plans, and RAG powered LLM feedback.
It was a lot to take in, but I was determined to make it work. I spent the first day learning about the tools and technologies I needed
to use.

I also met a lot of amazing people at the hackathon. The mentors were really helpful and supportive, and I got to learn a lot from them.
I also met a lot of other participants who were working on some really cool projects. I was inspired by their work and it motivated me to
keep going. The food was amazing, and the swag was really cool too. I got a lot of free stuff, including a t-shirt, a Devfolio sticker, and
a MagicPin voucher. The stay was also really comfortable.

Overall an amazing hackathon, and very different from the previous ones I had attended. I learned a lot, worked with actual people in
the industry instead of just college students, in a completely new city, full of tech people and startups everywhere. I also got to
work on a project that I was really passionate about, and I was able to build something that I was proud of. Cheers to Devfolio
for organizing such an amazing hackathon, and I hope to attend more of them in the future.
