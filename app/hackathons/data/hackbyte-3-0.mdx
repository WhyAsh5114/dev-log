Our second attempt at a Major League Hacking hackathon, and this time we were determined to make it work. We had a lot of experience 
from the <a href="/hackathons/hackhazards">last hackathon</a>, and we were ready to take on the challenge.

Travelled right this time, well rested, and ready to hack. We weren't super sure about the problem statements or the theme, so we just
went in with an open mind. Arrived at the venue, huge campus, with a lot of cool posters, banners, and setup. We were quite early but
they still accommodated us very well. They gave us a tote bag with a lot of swag, including a t-shirt, stickers, ID cards, and a lot more.

The opening ceremony happened, super chill, and we got to know the mentors and the problem statements. We were really excited about the 
problem statements, and we decided to work on the one that resonated with us the most. We wanted to create a solution that would help 
people access premium fitness services for free.

So we split up the work, got assigned our seats, and got to work. The mentoring sessions were really helpful, and we got a lot of
feedback on our project. We were able to iterate quickly and improve our solution based on the feedback we received. The food was decent,
but the sponsored food was great. We also won a minigame competition and got some cool swag for that.

We only got selected for the top 10, but we somehow won the GitHub award, for trakcing issues and pull requests, utilizing GitHub in the
right way, and having a well-documented project. We were really happy with that, as we had put a lot of effort into making our project
well-documented and easy to understand.

Overall the hackathon was great, maybe the venue was a bit too small for the number of participants, but it was still manageable. The
canteen/mess was also a bit far away, but otherwise no complaints. Definitely would go back again!
