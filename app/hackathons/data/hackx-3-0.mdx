The second attempt at HackX, an NMIMS hackathon. Compared to <a href="/hackathons/hackx-2-0">last time</a>, we were 
so much more prepared with a few hackathons under our belt. We had a solid idea, a well-defined tech stack, and a 
clear plan of action. We received our problem statements a day before, and we were ready to go.

Registration was smooth, the classrooms were great, and the food was decent. One unfortunate thing was that they
had to switch off the AC after 10 PM, which made it a bit uncomfortable for us night owls. But we managed.
This was the first hackathon where I finally gave in to vibe coding. We needed a Python backend for the AI
stuff, and I barely knew it. I just kept prompting for 12 hours, somehow getting it to work. It was a wild ride, but we
managed to build a working prototype.

The organizers were great, mentors suggested amazing features, and the judges were impressed with our
presentation. We ended up winning 2nd place, which was a huge achievement for us. We received 15k INR 
and a mechanical keyboard from Kreo which was pretty cool.
