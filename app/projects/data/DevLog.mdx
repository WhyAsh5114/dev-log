# WhyAsh5114's dev-log

## About
Built with Next.js and the Shadcn/ui component library, my developer portfolio 
emphasizes optimal loading speed and SEO. Utilized React's features like partial 
prerendering and static parameters to boost performance. Implementing React Server 
Components (RSCs) allows for minimal client-side JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight 
and efficient user experience. Additionally, the Suspense API is used for handling 
asynchronous data fetching, enhancing the loading experience while maintaining a 
minimal JavaScript load.
