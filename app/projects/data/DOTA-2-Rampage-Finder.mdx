# Dota2-Rampage-Finder

## Simply run the code in an IDE and enter:
1. Steam Account ID (aka Friend ID)
2. Steam Web API Key (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
3. Number of matches to look for rampages

## Requirements:
1. kivy

## Limitations:
1. Can only look for 100 matches
2. Too old unparsed matches won't be able to be parsed as their replays are no longer available
