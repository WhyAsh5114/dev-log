# FitSnap - Personalized Virtual Wardrobe

FitSnap is an AI-powered application that not only predicts your shoulder width, chest, and waist measurements based on your height but also offers a unique social experience. Engage with a Tinder-like interface to swipe right on outfits you love from other users and virtually try them on by overlaying the selected clothing onto your photo.

## Features

- **Accurate Measurement Predictions**: Utilizes advanced AI models to estimate key body measurements.
- **Personalized Size Recommendations**: Suggests optimal clothing sizes tailored to your body profile.
- **Social Outfit Discovery**: Explore and like outfits from other users with an intuitive swipe interface.
- **Virtual Try-On**: Overlay liked outfits onto your photo using cutting-edge image processing techniques.

## Virtual Try-On Technology

FitSnap's virtual try-on feature employs a combination of advanced technologies:

1. **Clothing Segmentation with U2NET**: Segments clothing items from images to isolate them for overlay.
2. **Pose Estimation with MediaPipe**: Detects and aligns body joints to ensure accurate placement of clothing.
3. **Image Processing with OpenCV**: Overlays segmented clothing onto user photos, adjusting for pose and alignment.
