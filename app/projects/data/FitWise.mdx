## üöß Challenges I Ran Into

Building FitWise presented several unique technical challenges that required innovative solutions:

### **MediaPipe Angle Data Preprocessing**
Transforming raw MediaPipe pose landmarks into meaningful angle data for LLM consumption was more complex than anticipated. The challenge involved:
- **Noisy Landmark Data**: MediaPipe outputs can be jittery, requiring sophisticated smoothing algorithms
- **Multi-Joint Coordination**: Creating composite angle signals from multiple body joints while maintaining biomechanical accuracy
- **Peak Detection Logic**: Developing adaptive algorithms to detect rep peaks/valleys across different exercise patterns
- **Angle Normalization**: Ensuring angle data is consistent and interpretable for downstream LLM analysis

**Solution**: Implemented weighted composite angle calculations with moving average smoothing and adaptive peak detection that considers exercise-specific movement patterns.

### **Real-Time Model Streaming with Minimal Latency**
Achieving fast response times while coordinating multiple AI models (LLM, RAG, TTS) proved challenging:
- **RAG Pipeline Bottleneck**: Vector search in Qdrant + embedding generation + LLM processing created latency spikes
- **Streaming Conflicts**: Balancing real-time pose feedback with chat-based AI responses
- **Memory Management**: Local models consuming significant RAM while maintaining smooth pose detection
- **Tool Coordination**: Managing sequential tool calls without blocking the UI

**Solution**: Implemented relevance thresholding (70%+) for RAG, aggressive caching of exercise configs, and background streaming with tool call optimization.

### **Quality Data Scraping for RAG Embeddings**
Building a robust knowledge base from exercise science content required careful data curation:
- **Content Quality**: Filtering scientific articles from fitness blog spam and misinformation
- **Source Diversity**: Balancing peer-reviewed research with practical training insights
- **Embedding Consistency**: Ensuring local embedding models produce meaningful vector representations
- **Data Structure**: Organizing scraped content for optimal retrieval performance

**Solution**: Focused on reputable sources (RPStrength, research papers), implemented content validation, and used proven embedding models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

### **Local Model Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs**
Running everything locally for privacy while maintaining performance created difficult compromises:
- **Model Size Limitations**: Smaller models (3B-4B parameters) vs. quality of larger cloud models
- **Hardware Constraints**: Balancing LLM inference, embedding generation, and MediaPipe processing on consumer hardware
- **Response Quality**: Local models sometimes producing less nuanced feedback compared to GPT-4 class models
- **Context Length**: Smaller models struggling with long conversation history and complex RAG context

**Solution**: Chose `qwen3-4b` for good instruction following, implemented smart context truncation, and optimized prompts for smaller model capabilities while maintaining acceptable quality.
