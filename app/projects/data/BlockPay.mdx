# BlockPay

BlockPay is a streamlined solution for simplifying cross-border payments. It leverages blockchain technology to offer fast, 
low-cost, and transparent transactions without reliance on traditional banking infrastructure.  

## Key Features
- **Instant Transactions** – Faster settlements compared to traditional remittance services.  
- **Low Fees** – Eliminates high conversion and transfer fees.  
- **Multi-Currency Support** – Enables seamless transactions across different fiat and cryptocurrencies.  
- **Decentralized & Secure** – Uses smart contracts to ensure trustless and tamper-proof transactions.  
- **Compliance & KYC Integration** – Facilitates regulatory compliance while preserving user privacy.  

BlockPay empowers individuals and businesses to send and receive payments globally with minimal friction.

## Challenges Faced

One of the biggest challenges we encountered was the lack of 1-to-1 fiat-pegged tokens on testnets. Since stablecoins like 
USDC and USDT are crucial for cross-border payments, their absence or unreliable availability on test networks made testing 
real-world scenarios difficult.  

To work around this, we had to map the testnet tokens to real ones, which introduced inconsistencies when simulating real-world 
liquidity and exchange rates. This also made it harder to validate transaction flows under realistic conditions.  

Ensuring a smooth user experience despite these limitations required additional effort in designing fallback mechanisms 
and adaptable smart contracts.
