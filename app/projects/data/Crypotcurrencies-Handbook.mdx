# Token Viewer App

Just a simple token viewer app made in **NextJS** and **React**, search for common coins 
like ETH & USDT, view a simple description, and click on the link for more info.

Has a local database: ```database.ts```, which contains all the tokens and their basic info.
I just made this as a pet project to get familiar with NextJS, React and Mantine.
