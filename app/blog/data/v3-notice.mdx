I have received quite the traffic in v2, *I am super happy about that*

Unfortunately, even though I wanted to, I couldn't fully implement all the features of v2 before launch, I hurried a lot

I have began work on v3 now, this time it will be a full fledged app with all the features from start, **and not break any important features after launch**

Developing v3 will take a long time *(~2 months)*, but if there are some important features that you guys wish to have in v2, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit/issues)

The reason I am working on v3 and not implementing the new features directly in v2 is cause of potential migration problems, v3's schema will be different from v2's. Don't worry though, I will definitely make a migration script after v3 has finished development for an easy upgrade to v3

Some new features that I'm working on in v3 are:

- Offline support
- Automatic recovery suggestions
- Automatic deload creator
- Better and *working* analytics
- *Open to suggestions, [open an issue!](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit/issues)*
