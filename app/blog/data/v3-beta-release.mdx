I said I'd try to write a blog post every month, but I got busy with college admissions and stuff. 
And honestly, I got a Deadlock invite (the game), and it was way too enticing to miss out on. Met up 
with friends as we hadn't seen each other for quite some time. So basically, I procrastinated working 
on the app for the better part of August.

After finishing up the admissions process, I had a bit of breathing room before the start of the 
academic year. I got the motivation to start working on the app again and learned a lot about GitHub 
guidelines and issue tracking from a friend. 

A beta version of V3 was released for testing and feedback, and people started opening issues 
like bug reports and feature requests. After seeing positive comments when I resolved the GitHub 
issues and discussed the app with others, I WANTED to work on the app. Closing issues one by one 
while interacting with the community has a different kind of satisfaction to it.

Unfortunately, there were a LOT more things remaining to finish off before I could release the V3-stable 
version. And I couldn't finish them before college, and now I'm buried under assignments, practicals, and lectures. 

So I will be slowing down work on the app for now, and when a new holiday season arrives, giving me 
some free time, I'll catch up on the issues. 

Here's the V3-beta link for anyone who missed it on GitHub:
