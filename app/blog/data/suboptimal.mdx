To avoid keeping everyone in complete darkness, I've created a 
[GitHub discussion](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit/discussions/45) which 
I'll try to update regularly.

"Sub-optimal" â€” you might've heard this word many times on social media: influencers telling 
you that this exercise is "sub-optimal" for this head of this muscle group and that you SHOULD NOT 
do it AT ALL. Sometimes it is true and well-intended, but many times it's just unnecessary and a 
lot more nuanced. Fitness should be considered with context, and so should exercises. Some exercises 
might not be "optimal," but they might feel better on your joints, or you might simply enjoy them more. 
Keeping a black-and-white view of exercises as simply optimal vs. not optimal is not good for long-term goals.

I've learned this same lesson when making this app on the technical side as well. Sometimes you can't 
get the optimal structure or pristine code with perfect readability, and you should be fine with it. 
I've re-made this same workout app about four times now, each time learning new things and getting better 
at it. Instead of aiming for perfect code, I've now started to aim for "good enough" code. Otherwise, I'll 
never be able to release v3 and will be stuck in my OCD forever.

Tech updates:

- Moved to CockroachDB from Neon for the lower latency and higher storage (10GiB free!)
- A good CI/CD pipeline that will work for PRs as well

Again, I'm just a college student who's barely an adult. This blog is a place where I plan to share 
my journey of building this application. None of this is scientific advice, just my opinion on things 
I've built by watching tons of Dr. Mike on YouTube ðŸ˜…
