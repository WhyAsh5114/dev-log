After almost a year of waiting, I'm proud to announce that [MyFit V3](https://my-fit-v3.vercel.app) is now officially released 🎉🎉🎉! Here's a glimpse of the new features:

- Brand new, clean UI with dark and light modes
- Detailed statistics for all kinds of metrics
- Adjust mesocycle split during its active phase
- Drag and drop exercises to change their order
- Volume progression customizations per muscle group
- Better handling of bodyweight exercises

You can also migrate all your data from V2 to V3! To migrate, just go to your [profile page in V3](https://my-fit-v3.vercel.app/profile) from the top navbar and hit “Start migration.” There are some limitations due to schema mismatches:

- You **should NOT** have an active mesocycle in V2. If you do, you can finish it at your own pace and migrate later, no rush.
- You'll need a single **average bodyweight** to back-fill all workouts.
- You'll need a single **average workout duration** to back-fill all workouts.

Although I've thoroughly tested the app and have been using it for quite some time, there might still be small bugs. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit/issues) if you encounter any. Thank you all for your patience!
