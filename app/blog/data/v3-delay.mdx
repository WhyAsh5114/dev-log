TLDR: Life happened. and I wasn't happy with the current tech stack, so I'm sorry but it's gonna take quite some more time

Yeah... that didn't pan out well. It's been almost half an year since I made the v3 notice. I was naive to believe 
that I'd actually be able to complete the thing in 2 months. I didn't expect so much stuff to happen in this last 
semester of my diploma, basketball, hackathons, college events, and even exams! I still tried to put in as much work 
in v3 as I could, but the code quality was deteriorating over time as I was starting to do the same thing I did in v2, rush things.

I wasn't happy with how the spaghetti code looked, I just knew this was something that would become a disaster to 
manage later on, so instead of trying to deliver a rushed app again, I've decided to let v3 take as much time as it needs.

I also need to change the tech stack entirely.

- I'm moving away from MongoDB with API endpoints, to server-side streamed Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL hosted on 
Neon, this should offer much better type safety without code duplication and better performance.
- I'm also going to use shadcn-svelte for this project instead of DaisyUI, it looks very cool and is quite low-effort tbh.
- I also want to use Svelte 5, but I need to wait a bit as the shadcn-svelte library isn't yet fully ready for runes support.

"So how long will v3 take?", you may ask, and to answer that honestly, I don't know at this point, **I really don't 
want to rush this.** Sorry for making false promises, I didn't know any better.

I have my last sem exams now, after which I have a lot of free time to build, till then hopefully svelte 5 would be 
better supported in the ecosystem and the DX would be great too.

On a side note: v2 is still doing extremely well, there are 10000+ views every month, which is insane to me. So many 
people have opened helpful issues to suggest stuff and also told me to add a donations option, which is very cool, 
thanks a lot guys. As soon as exams are over, I'll start working on v3, I don't feel comfortable yet giving a specific 
timeline but I promise you this, I'll try my best to finish it as soon as possible.

Happy lifting!
