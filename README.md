# WhyAsh5114's Dev-Log


This is my blog/portfolio website for tech. It's made with **React** and **NextJS**. I used **Mantine** for the UI library and **TailwindCSS** for quick styling and layout

I used **MDX** so that I could quickly make new blog posts and project posts without having to code much, I just need to add the images in the right folder, specify some tags in the metadata, and it's done. *(MDX was a bit difficult to setup though)*.
