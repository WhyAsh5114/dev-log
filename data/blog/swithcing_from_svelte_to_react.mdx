As a web developer, you come across many ways to achieve the same goal: frameworks, technologies, 
languages, etc. There isn't just one way to make your dream web app; you can do whatever seems 
natural to you. You can use React, or you can use Angular, TypeScript, or vanilla JavaScript 
(pls don't do this), bundle using Webpack, or Vite. There are so many ways to do the same thing, 
which seems nice because we can choose the tech stack that we like, but it comes with a cost. 

As someone who has tinkered with many technologies, I didn't like the web development ecosystem 
because nothing is explicit. There are tens of frameworks to choose from, and even then, there 
are different ways of doing things (why does React still use class-based components in their docs). 
When I used to make websites around 2015, I just used HTML, CSS, and JS; life was simple. But when I 
came back after a few years, everything had changed so drastically; there were so many different ways 
to do the same thing that deciding on the stack became more stressful than trying to make the app itself. 
In competitive programming: I started using Python, but just because I could, it didn't mean I should; 
I quickly realized the cons of using Python in CP and switched to C++. There was a way of doing things 
in this space; I didn't mind switching. There may be different paths to achieve the same thing, but they should be 
relatively straightforward.

I started with Svelte, the perfect framework for me: easy to use and straightforward, and I rarely had 
to use npm install. But because Svelte was not popular among jobs and internships, I had to switch to React. 
It was tough, but the vast ecosystem was new and felt nice. I didn't have to implement complex components 
from scratch; they were just one npm install away. I found that the tutorial series on their websites used 
class-based components to teach; fortunately, I had heard Fireship.io say that "class-based components are 
literally - the devil.", so I quickly switched to a different tutorial and found NextJS' website. Their 
tutorial used function-based components; they were way better than class-based. To my surprise, it was better 
than the official React tutorial: easier to understand, small questions in every section, and beginner-friendly. 

React is so different from Svelte that it felt like switching from Python to C++. Now that I have used React 
and Next for some time, I can confidently say that: Svelte is better; I would've never switched if there 
was even a slightly larger ecosystem and was in demand by jobs and internships. As SvelteKit approaches 
stable release, companies may slowly adopt Svelte, but it will take a while. For now though, because I am 
looking for internships, I will be using React and Next.
