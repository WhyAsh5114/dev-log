A web app built with **React** and **Next** which allows you
to search for commonly used cryptocurrencies and get a simple description
along with some tags, a logo, and the website link.

<Carousel imageDir={metadata.imageDir} images={metadata.images} />

I built this small app just to get used to NextJS and the React ecosystem,
it uses the Mantine UI library for the components and TailwindCSS for general layout.
There is a local TS file which contains the database object, and NextJS automatically
builds all the routes according to that database object at build time, which allows for 
fast load times as all the routes are pre rendered. The dynamic tokens page significantly
reduces the amount of time needed to add a new coin to look at, generally I'd have to create
an entire new HTML page, but with the power of React and Next, I can simply add an entry to the
database with just the information, and all of it will be rendered automatically. The website
is hosted on Vercel.
