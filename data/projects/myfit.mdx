A web app built with **Svelte** and **SvelteKit** which tracks a vast array of fitness
metrics like workouts, splits, nutrition and sleep. 

<Carousel imageDir={metadata.imageDir} images={metadata.images} />

I built this app because there was no other app which allowed me to track so many metrics
at the same time and graph them to show meaningful relations between them. There's nutrition,
sleep, workouts, steps, protein intake, heart rate, cardio, and others which do impact one's
daily performance, tracking them might help find issues with the current approach or advantages
of the current approach, like lack of sleep might sound obvious but when you see the plots of 
daily workout volume and sleep quality graphed against each other, you realize how important it is.
This app will take quite some time to finish as there are a lot of features and I have to keep up 
with the updates to SvelteKit as it's in beta and there are a few bugs; one super annoying bug that 
I have to workaround right now is session management, I can't navigate smoothly between login and other
pages because of it which ruins the experience, but the bug is marked as important on the SvelteKit repo
and should be fixed soon. *fingers crossed*
