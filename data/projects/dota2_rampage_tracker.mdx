A desktop application built using **Python** and the **Kivy** framework which allows
us to find the previous *game IDs* in which *rampages* (an in game achievement) were 
achieved, using the **Steam API** and the **OpenDOTA API**.

A Reddit user wanted to find their last games in which they achieved a rampage (an in game achievement),
unfortunately this data wasn't directly available in the game-client, so I tried to help them by 
creating an app which goes through all games available on the user's account and checks if they 
had any rampages, if they did, the Game ID would get added to a list and be displayed. When making this
app I learned a lot about APIs, API keys, rate limiting, filtering and parsing. Python isn't meant for 
making Desktop apps, but there is a decent framework: Kivy, which served my use case for this small project.
